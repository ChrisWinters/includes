WordPress Plugin - Includes for WordPress - Include Content Anywhere!


## Description

Include Content Anywhere! Create, manage, published, and schedule custom posts directly into widgets, widget titles, menu items, posts, pages, custom post types (yes, WooCommerce too), and even theme templates. Create advertisments that can automatically update or randomly display. Split test opt-in forms or any other content. Published pre-created scheduled front pages based on holidays or promotions. Easily update duplicated content (like author bios, realtor requirements, shop guarantees, etc) all from a single location.
